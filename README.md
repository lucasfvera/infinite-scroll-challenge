# HomeVision Frontend Challenge

---

This is a take home interview for HomeVision that focuses primarily on writing clean code that accomplishes a very practical task.

## Goal

The challenge is to build a **simple web app that displays an infinite scrolling of house data**. We’d prefer if you used React (or a React-based framework like Nextjs) but feel free to use any library for the UI components.

**Note:** this is a *flaky* API! That means that it will likely fail with a non-200 response code. Your code *must* handle these errors correctly so that all photos are displayed without issues.

## API Endpoint

You can request the data using the following endpoint:

```
https://staging.homevision.co/api_project/houses
```

This route by itself will respond with a default list of houses (or a server error!). You can use the following URL parameters:

- `page`: the page number you want to retrieve (default is 1).
- `per_page`: the number of houses per page (default is 10, max is 500).

## Requirements

- Use React and TypeScript
- Design and implement a system to display the results of the API calls to a user
- Include instructions on how to run the project

## Bonus Points

- Add some additional features that require more complex interactions
- Show off your understanding of what is required to build and run a production application -  through comments and/or implementation of those requirements

## Submitting

- Provide either a zip file with your code (preferred) or a link to a public github repo.

Please let us know if you have any questions!
